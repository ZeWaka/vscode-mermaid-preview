# Mermaid Charty Preview - 1.0 extension for Visual Studio Code

### This is a fork of the [original Mermaid Preview extension](https://github.com/vstirbu/vscode-mermaid-preview/tree/9e7de6e390cc1dbec21c5abbb9ba0a09ce0ed9d3) after the terrible 2.0 update.

### I commit to never updating this extension, and deleting it if stops working for me.

This extension is a Tool for visualizing and editing Mermaid diagrams in Visual Studio Code.The extension enables developers to view and edit diagrams stored in Mermaid Chart from Visual Studio Code. With the integration to the Mermaid Chart service, this extension allows users to attach diagrams to their code and to gain quick access to updating diagrams.

Simplify your development workflow with the Mermaid Charty Preview extension.

## Features

In the explorer view under the MERMAIDCHART section you will find all the diagrams you have access to. When you click on a diagram, that diagram will be inserted into the code editor at the position of the cursor. To get the latest changes of diagrams from Mermaid Chart, click on the button named Refresh in the explorer view.

You can attach diagrams into your code. The attachments are highlighted with an icon in the footer.

You have two links associated with he diagram, one for viewing the diagram in a new tab in Visual Studio Code and one that opens the diagram for editing at Mermaid Chart. This way it is easy to consume the diagram as well as updating it if some detail needs to be corrected.

The following image show how a new tab is opened with the diagram after clicking on the view diagram link:

The other link opens the diagram for editing in a browser window.
